# TestWeb

## Problems
### Tasks
- Add comments functionality to the post on postâ€™s details view (create/delete is enough). 
- Split post's AuthorName (Post.AuthorName) field into Name (Post.Name) and Domain (Post.Domain) with respect to existed data consistency in DB. 

Cant finished this tasks, because I have problem with enabling migrations and update-database, i think the reason is local nuget packages. I tried fix it but spent a lot of time for resolving this problems, maybe when have free time, i'll try fix it again; 
### Security/Performance
Done only first task. Second task was hard for me, so i didn't try fix optional tasks and most of the time I spend on task 3(comments).

Total time that i spent for work with test task equals 8-9 hours

#### By the way, that was a good experience for me. Thank you so much for this!
